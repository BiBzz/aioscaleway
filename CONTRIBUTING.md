# Contributing

## Setting up

The project is managed with [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/), 0.13 or later:

```bash
uv sync
```

It uses the interpreter in `.python-version`, the oldest version the library
supports.

## The checks

These are the gates CI runs on every merge request:

```bash
uv run ruff check .
uv run ruff format --check .
uv run python scripts/generate.py && git diff --exit-code -- src docs
uv run mypy
uv run pytest -q
```

The tests run on Python 3.12, 3.13 and 3.14 in CI.

## Generated code

Everything under `src/aioscaleway/_operations/` and the area packages
(`src/aioscaleway/compute/`...) is generated, as are `docs/objects.md` and
`docs/coverage.md`; each generated file starts with a line saying so. Change
the generators (`scripts/operations.py`, `scripts/objects.py`), the naming
table (`mapping.yaml`) or the hand-written runtime (`src/aioscaleway/_*.py`),
never the output, then regenerate:

```bash
uv run python scripts/generate.py
```

The generator stops on a name clash and says which entry of `mapping.yaml` to
add. Read the diff of `docs/objects.md`: it is the public surface.

To pick up what Scaleway changed in its APIs:

```bash
scripts/fetch_specs.sh
```

It downloads every OpenAPI file listed on the developers website and
regenerates. Commit the specs and the generated code together, in a merge
request of their own: its diff is the list of API changes.

## Commits

Work branches off `development`, the default branch, and lands through a
merge request. Everything in the repository is written in English, and commit
messages follow the Angular convention: `feat(client): ...`,
`fix(generator): ...`, `docs: ...`. Commits are signed.

## The changelog

Anything a user of the library would notice goes under `## [Unreleased]` in
[CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md), in the merge request that changes the behaviour.
The format is [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/).

## Releasing

1. In a merge request, bump `version` in `pyproject.toml`, run `uv lock`, and
   turn the `## [Unreleased]` section into the release:

   ```bash
   python3 scripts/roll_changelog.py 0.2.0
   ```

2. Once it is merged, from an up to date `development`:

   ```bash
   scripts/release.sh
   ```

   It checks the tree matches `origin`, the commit is signed and the
   changelog has the section, replays the checks, signs the `v0.2.0` tag with
   the changelog entry as its message, and pushes it after asking.

3. The tag pipeline runs the checks again, then stops on the manual `publish`
   job. Starting it is the point of no return: a version on PyPI can be yanked,
   but its files can never be uploaded again. The job builds the wheel and the
   sdist and uploads them with PyPI trusted publishing, so no token is stored
   anywhere.

The GitLab project mirrors itself to GitHub, tags included.

### What PyPI trusts

The trusted publisher declared on PyPI for `aioscaleway` is the GitLab project
`businessagile/libraries/aioscaleway`, pipeline file `.gitlab-ci.yml`,
environment `pypi`. Renaming the project, the file or the environment breaks
the upload until the publisher is updated on PyPI. Tags matching `v*` are
protected, so only maintainers can start a release.
